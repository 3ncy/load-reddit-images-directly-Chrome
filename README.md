# Load Reddit Images Directly
Firefox web extension that loads reddit images directly instead of referring to the HTML page containing the image. This works for i.redd.it, preview.redd.it and external-preview.redd.it urls.

For a Chrome version, refer to https://github.com/MonsterMannen/reddit-load-images-directly-chrome.
